Jason Payne
Personal Website

For this assignment, I have four main files: 
1) index.html is the default page, with a title, a picture, and two links.
2) bio.html simply has a title and a very short biography about me.
3) resume.html is the largest file, with my entire resume divided into four sections.
4) style.css is the stylesheet for all three html pages, with several tags to vary structure mildly. 
There is also a jason_profile.jpg that is the picture on the index.html page.

Citing:
All color codes were taken from google.
The redirection from the CS page was found from google as well. The exact link is in the file that handles the redirect.
Everything else was derived from either class or trail-and-error.
